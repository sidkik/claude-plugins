# Apply packaged sources in the working repository

The bundle is a generated, revision-pinned distribution of shared instructions.
Its source manifest records each upstream repository, commit and byte digest.
Update the canonical source, then regenerate the package; edit wrappers only
through the generator. Managed planning documents retain their canonical owner
and become provenance-bearing snapshots in this distribution.

1. Establish the actual working repository and its Git remotes. Read its
   `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`, configured `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` when present,
   and applicable engineering instructions. The plugin installation directory
   is a source location, never the work's repository or checkout.
2. Read the packaged SDLC entry and its required orchestrator dependency before
   route selection. Apply current user authorization and source precedence from
   the host. If a repository distributes a different shared-process revision,
   identify that conflict and its effect before the dependent action; installing
   a plugin does not silently revoke the repository's instructions.
3. The bundled tracker supplies Sidkik's GitHub mechanics. Resolve the owning
   delivery issue from its full URL and actual work scope. Planning documents
   belong to `sidkik/planning`, including single-repository work launched in a
   delivery checkout. Before writing them, natively invoke
   [work-artifacts](skills/work-artifacts/SKILL.md) and read its linked planning
   storage/publication convention. Delivery implementation, maintained technical
   documentation, implementation evidence and implementation-session continuity
   retain their delivery owner; a sufficient small repair brief can remain
   issue-owned. This does not reassign implementation issues to planning.
   Discover the actual configured owner before creating work.
4. Resolve engineering instructions through their configured canonical owner.
   Follow the working repository's explicit ownership/migration configuration
   and applicable user decisions for architecture, testing and local-development
   rules, specialist briefs and maintained governing references. When that owner
   is an engineering plugin, use its canonical sources or exact installed bundle
   for those instructions. From any starting repository, route contributions to
   the plugin-owned sources to the owner's authorized checkout; generated bundles,
   wrappers and agents remain distribution outputs.
   For Core's explicitly adopted migration, `sidkik/core-plugins` owns these
   engineering instructions under `core-engineering/source`. Legacy Core copies
   of migrated instructions cannot silently override that authority; report
   conflicts before dependent work. This scoped migration preserves unrelated
   repository instructions and does not require other repositories to depend on
   the private plugin.
   The working delivery repository retains implementation code and tests,
   runtime/configuration and live environment, tool and operational facts.
   Observe its write boundaries and the source owner's separate write boundaries;
   a starting directory does not authorize writes to another checkout. Runtime
   commands come from the installed crew runtime documentation and skills.
   Report missing source access or capabilities for the affected action; a plugin
   does not grant permissions or authenticate a CLI.
5. Preserve Pocock's pinned sources and Sidkik's deliberate invocation-only
   adaptation: the Pocock workflows are model-invocable, so invoke the selected
   flow natively from the user's ordinary request; loading grants no authority
   and decides nothing for the human. For a skill still restricted to the user,
   follow the SDLC entry's handoff: provide the actual installed slash command
   with the current work reference and wait for the user's invocation. Source
   inspection may identify that command; it cannot replace invoking or
   authorize executing the flow. If no valid invocation is exposed, report the
   capability gap and hold only dependent work. Sidkik's process
   and tracker adaptations govern local-tracker defaults. Optional flows named
   by the broader Pocock router but absent here remain unavailable until their
   actual source is installed; never claim to have applied a missing skill.

Historical research and decision pointers are immutable upstream links. They
supply provenance when relevant; installed local sources supply required process
steps. A private GitHub link still requires access. This package provides agent
instructions, not authenticated enforcement or a workflow engine.
