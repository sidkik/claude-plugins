> Source precedence: apply the [source adapter contract](#apply-packaged-sources-in-the-working-repository) at the end of this skill for working-repository ownership and source precedence.

This skill takes the current conversation context and codebase understanding and produces a spec. Do NOT interview the user; just synthesize what you already know.

The issue tracker and triage label vocabulary should have been provided to you. If not, tell the user to run `/setup-matt-pocock-skills`.

## Process

1. Explore the repo to understand the current state of the codebase, if you haven't already. Use the project's domain glossary vocabulary throughout the spec, and respect any ADRs in the area you're touching.

2. Sketch out the seams at which you're going to test the feature. Existing seams should be preferred to new ones. Use the highest seam possible. If new seams are needed, propose them at the highest point you can. The fewer seams across the codebase, the better - the ideal number is one.

Check with the user that these seams match their expectations.

3. Write the spec using the template below, then publish it to the project issue tracker. Apply the `ready-for-agent` triage label - no need for additional triage.

<spec-template>

## Problem Statement

The problem that the user is facing, from the user's perspective.

## Solution

The solution to the problem, from the user's perspective.

## User Stories

A LONG, numbered list of user stories. Each user story should be in the format of:

1. As an <actor>, I want a <feature>, so that <benefit>

<user-story-example>
1. As a mobile bank customer, I want to see balance on my accounts, so that I can make better informed decisions about my spending
</user-story-example>

This list of user stories should be extremely extensive and cover all aspects of the feature.

## Implementation Decisions

A list of implementation decisions that were made. This can include:

- The modules that will be built/modified
- The interfaces of those modules that will be modified
- Technical clarifications from the developer
- Architectural decisions
- Schema changes
- API contracts
- Specific interactions

Do NOT include specific file paths or code snippets. They may end up being outdated very quickly.

Exception: if a prototype produced a snippet that encodes a decision more precisely than prose can (state machine, reducer, schema, type shape), inline it within the relevant decision and note briefly that it came from a prototype. Trim to the decision-rich parts, not a working demo, just the important bits.

## Testing Decisions

A list of testing decisions that were made. Include:

- A description of what makes a good test (only test external behavior, not implementation details)
- Which modules will be tested
- Prior art for the tests (i.e. similar types of tests in the codebase)

## Out of Scope

A description of the things that are out of scope for this spec.

## Further Notes

Any further notes about the feature.

## Source adapter contract

<!-- source: maintained in this repository, sdlc-process/SOURCE-ADAPTER.md -->

### Apply packaged sources in the working repository

The bundle is a generated, revision-pinned distribution of shared instructions.
Its source manifest records each upstream repository, commit and byte digest.
Update the canonical source, then regenerate the package; native skills and
agents are generated outputs and are never edited directly. Managed planning
documents retain their canonical owner and become provenance-bearing snapshots
in this distribution.

Native skills and agents contain their instructions; they are not pointers. Each
has the pinned source's frontmatter, its full pinned body, the supporting
instruction and template files that body requires, and this contract.
Invoking one loads all of that: the `Skill` result is the packaged source, so a
separate read of the same file adds nothing and never substitutes for the
invocation. Links that remain are not bundled: other skills (invoke them), and
canonical process, specification and record documents under `bundle/`
(read the sections the current action relies on). `native-composition.json`
lists every asset's bundled files and retained links with sizes. Report a
retained rule you needed but could not read as a scoped load gap; do not
claim complete coverage of a rule you did not read.

1. Establish the actual working repository and its Git remotes. Read its
   `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`, configured `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` when present,
   and applicable engineering instructions. The plugin installation directory
   is a source location, never the work's repository or checkout.
2. Read the packaged SDLC entry and its required orchestrator dependency before
   route selection. Apply current user authorization and source precedence from
   the host. If a repository distributes a different shared-process revision,
   identify that conflict and its effect before the dependent action; installing
   a plugin does not silently revoke the repository's instructions.
3. The bundled tracker supplies Sidkik's GitHub mechanics. Resolve the owning
   delivery issue from its full URL and actual work scope. Planning documents
   belong to `sidkik/planning`, including single-repository work launched in a
   delivery checkout. Before writing them, natively invoke
   [work-artifacts](../work-artifacts/SKILL.md) and read its linked planning
   storage/publication convention. Delivery implementation, maintained technical
   documentation, implementation evidence and implementation-session continuity
   retain their delivery owner; a sufficient small repair brief can remain
   issue-owned. This does not reassign implementation issues to planning.
   Discover the actual configured owner before creating work.
4. Resolve engineering instructions through their configured canonical owner.
   Follow the working repository's explicit ownership/migration configuration
   and applicable user decisions for architecture, testing and local-development
   rules, specialist briefs and maintained governing references. When that owner
   is an engineering plugin, use its canonical sources or exact installed bundle
   for those instructions. From any starting repository, route contributions to
   the plugin-owned sources to the owner's authorized checkout; generated bundles,
   native skills and agents remain distribution outputs.
   For Core's explicitly adopted migration, `sidkik/core-plugins` owns these
   engineering instructions under `core-engineering/source`. Legacy Core copies
   of migrated instructions cannot silently override that authority; report
   conflicts before dependent work. This scoped migration preserves unrelated
   repository instructions and does not require other repositories to depend on
   the private plugin.
   The working delivery repository retains implementation code and tests,
   runtime/configuration and live environment, tool and operational facts.
   Observe its write boundaries and the source owner's separate write boundaries;
   a starting directory does not authorize writes to another checkout. Runtime
   commands come from the installed crew runtime documentation and skills.
   Report missing source access or capabilities for the affected action; a plugin
   does not grant permissions or authenticate a CLI.
5. Preserve Pocock's pinned sources and Sidkik's deliberate invocation-only
   adaptation: the Pocock workflows are model-invocable, so invoke the selected
   flow natively from the user's ordinary request; loading grants no authority
   and decides nothing for the human. For a skill still restricted to the user,
   follow the SDLC entry's handoff: provide the actual installed slash command
   with the current work reference and wait for the user's invocation. Source
   inspection may identify that command; it cannot replace invoking or
   authorize executing the flow. If no valid invocation is exposed, report the
   capability gap and hold only dependent work. Sidkik's process
   and tracker adaptations govern local-tracker defaults. Optional flows named
   by the broader Pocock router but absent here remain unavailable until their
   actual source is installed; never claim to have applied a missing skill.

Historical research and decision pointers are immutable upstream links. They
supply provenance when relevant; installed local sources supply required process
steps. A private GitHub link still requires access. This package provides agent
instructions, not authenticated enforcement or a workflow engine.
