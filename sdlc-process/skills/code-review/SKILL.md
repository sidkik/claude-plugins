name: code-review
description: "Review the changes since a fixed point (commit, branch, tag, or merge-base) along two axes: Standards (does the code follow this repo's documented coding standards?) and Spec (does the code match what the originating issue/spec asked for?). Runs both reviews in parallel sub-agents and reports them side by side. Use when the user wants to review a branch, a PR, work-in-progress changes, or asks to \"review since X\"."

Read and follow [the packaged source](../../bundle/.agents/skills/code-review/SKILL.md) in full, and read the references it directs for the current action before performing the flow; report an unavailable required source as a scoped load gap. Before applying it, read [the source adapter](../../SOURCE-ADAPTER.md) for working-repository ownership and source precedence. This wrapper supplies discovery; it does not replace the source instructions.
