# Domain Modeling

Actively build and sharpen the project's domain model as you design. This is the *active* discipline: challenging terms, inventing edge-case scenarios, and writing the glossary and decisions down the moment they crystallise. (Merely *reading* `CONTEXT.md` for vocabulary is not this skill: that's a one-line habit any skill can do. This skill is for when you're changing the model, not just consuming it.)

## File structure

Most repos have a single context:

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/
│   └── adr/
│       ├── 0001-event-sourced-orders.md
│       └── 0002-postgres-for-write-model.md
└── src/
```

If a `CONTEXT-MAP.md` exists at the root, the repo has multiple contexts. The map points to where each one lives:

```
/
├── CONTEXT-MAP.md
├── docs/
│   └── adr/                          ← system-wide decisions
├── src/
│   ├── ordering/
│   │   ├── CONTEXT.md
│   │   └── docs/adr/                 ← context-specific decisions
│   └── billing/
│       ├── CONTEXT.md
│       └── docs/adr/
```

Create files lazily: only when you have something to write. If no `CONTEXT.md` exists, create one when the first term is resolved. If no `docs/adr/` exists, create it when the first ADR is needed.

## During the session

### Challenge against the glossary

When the user uses a term that conflicts with the existing language in `CONTEXT.md`, call it out immediately. "Your glossary defines 'cancellation' as X, but you seem to mean Y. Which is it?"

### Sharpen fuzzy language

When the user uses vague or overloaded terms, propose a precise canonical term. "You're saying 'account': do you mean the Customer or the User? Those are different things."

### Discuss concrete scenarios

When domain relationships are being discussed, stress-test them with specific scenarios. Invent scenarios that probe edge cases and force the user to be precise about the boundaries between concepts.

### Cross-reference with code

When the user states how something works, check whether the code agrees. If you find a contradiction, surface it: "Your code cancels entire Orders, but you just said partial cancellation is possible. Which is right?"

### Update CONTEXT.md inline

When a term is resolved, update `CONTEXT.md` right there. Don't batch these up: capture them as they happen. Use the format in [CONTEXT-FORMAT.md](#bundled-agents-skills-domain-modeling-context-format-md).

`CONTEXT.md` should be totally devoid of implementation details. Do not treat `CONTEXT.md` as a spec, a scratch pad, or a repository for implementation decisions. It is a glossary and nothing else.

### Offer ADRs sparingly

Only offer to create an ADR when all three are true:

1. **Hard to reverse**: the cost of changing your mind later is meaningful
2. **Surprising without context**: a future reader will wonder "why did they do it this way?"
3. **The result of a real trade-off**: there were genuine alternatives and you picked one for specific reasons

If any of the three is missing, skip the ADR. Use the format in [ADR-FORMAT.md](#bundled-agents-skills-domain-modeling-adr-format-md).

## Bundled required dependencies

The instructions above require the following pinned files. They are included here so this invocation loads them; separately invoked skills are not.

### ADR Format

ADRs live in `docs/adr/` and use sequential numbering: `0001-slug.md`, `0002-slug.md`, etc.

Create the `docs/adr/` directory lazily: only when the first ADR is needed.

#### Template

```md
# {Short title of the decision}

{1-3 sentences: what's the context, what did we decide, and why.}
```

That's it. An ADR can be a single paragraph. The value is in recording *that* a decision was made and *why*, not in filling out sections.

#### Optional sections

Only include these when they add genuine value. Most ADRs won't need them.

- **Status** frontmatter (`proposed | accepted | deprecated | superseded by ADR-NNNN`): useful when decisions are revisited
- **Considered Options**: only when the rejected alternatives are worth remembering
- **Consequences**: only when non-obvious downstream effects need to be called out

#### Numbering

Scan `docs/adr/` for the highest existing number and increment by one.

#### When to offer an ADR

All three of these must be true:

1. **Hard to reverse**: the cost of changing your mind later is meaningful
2. **Surprising without context**: a future reader will look at the code and wonder "why on earth did they do it this way?"
3. **The result of a real trade-off**: there were genuine alternatives and you picked one for specific reasons

If a decision is easy to reverse, skip it: you'll just reverse it. If it's not surprising, nobody will wonder why. If there was no real alternative, there's nothing to record beyond "we did the obvious thing."

##### What qualifies

- **Architectural shape.** "We're using a monorepo." "The write model is event-sourced, the read model is projected into Postgres."
- **Integration patterns between contexts.** "Ordering and Billing communicate via domain events, not synchronous HTTP."
- **Technology choices that carry lock-in.** Database, message bus, auth provider, deployment target. Not every library: just the ones that would take a quarter to swap out.
- **Boundary and scope decisions.** "Customer data is owned by the Customer context; other contexts reference it by ID only." The explicit no-s are as valuable as the yes-s.
- **Deliberate deviations from the obvious path.** "We're using manual SQL instead of an ORM because X." Anything where a reasonable reader would assume the opposite. These stop the next engineer from "fixing" something that was deliberate.
- **Constraints not visible in the code.** "We can't use AWS because of compliance requirements." "Response times must be under 200ms because of the partner API contract."
- **Rejected alternatives when the rejection is non-obvious.** If you considered GraphQL and picked REST for subtle reasons, record it; otherwise someone will suggest GraphQL again in six months.

### CONTEXT.md Format

#### Structure

```md
# {Context Name}

{One or two sentence description of what this context is and why it exists.}

## Language

**Order**:
{A one or two sentence description of the term}
_Avoid_: Purchase, transaction

**Invoice**:
A request for payment sent to a customer after delivery.
_Avoid_: Bill, payment request

**Customer**:
A person or organization that places orders.
_Avoid_: Client, buyer, account
```

#### Rules

- **Be opinionated.** When multiple words exist for the same concept, pick the best one and list the others under `_Avoid_`.
- **Keep definitions tight.** One or two sentences max. Define what it IS, not what it does.
- **Only include terms specific to this project's context.** General programming concepts (timeouts, error types, utility patterns) don't belong even if the project uses them extensively. Before adding a term, ask: is this a concept unique to this context, or a general programming concept? Only the former belongs.
- **Group terms under subheadings** when natural clusters emerge. If all terms belong to a single cohesive area, a flat list is fine.

#### Single vs multi-context repos

**Single context (most repos):** One `CONTEXT.md` at the repo root.

**Multiple contexts:** A `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the repo root lists the contexts, where they live, and how they relate to each other:

```md
# Context Map

## Contexts

- [Ordering](./src/ordering/CONTEXT.md): receives and tracks customer orders
- [Billing](./src/billing/CONTEXT.md): generates invoices and processes payments
- [Fulfillment](./src/fulfillment/CONTEXT.md): manages warehouse picking and shipping

## Relationships

- **Ordering → Fulfillment**: Ordering emits `OrderPlaced` events; Fulfillment consumes them to start picking
- **Fulfillment → Billing**: Fulfillment emits `ShipmentDispatched` events; Billing consumes them to generate invoices
- **Ordering ↔ Billing**: Shared types for `CustomerId` and `Money`
```

The skill infers which structure applies:

- If `CONTEXT-MAP.md` exists, read it to find contexts
- If only a root `CONTEXT.md` exists, single context
- If neither exists, create a root `CONTEXT.md` lazily when the first term is resolved

When multiple contexts exist, infer which one the current topic relates to. If unclear, ask.

## Source adapter contract

<!-- source: maintained in this repository, sdlc-process/SOURCE-ADAPTER.md -->

### Apply packaged sources in the working repository

The bundle is a generated, revision-pinned distribution of shared instructions.
Its source manifest records each upstream repository, commit and byte digest.
Update the canonical source, then regenerate the package; native skills and
agents are generated outputs and are never edited directly. Managed planning
documents retain their canonical owner and become provenance-bearing snapshots
in this distribution.

Native skills and agents contain their instructions; they are not pointers. Each
has the pinned source's frontmatter, its full pinned body, the supporting
instruction and template files that body requires, the shared process,
specification, record, planning and tracker content that its flows make mandatory
(the whole process where the source directs reading it), and this contract.
Invoking one delivers all of that: the `Skill` result (or the agent's own
definition) is the content, so loading needs no separate read of any source file
and a read never substitutes for the invocation. Links that remain point to
separate assets or facts: other skills (invoke each by its name when the work
reaches it), live project facts such as tracker configuration, issue state,
ownership and repository documents (discover them from their owners when the
action needs them), and pinned historical evidence or the governed-context
proposal's identity (its governing sections are carried here). `native-composition.json`
lists every asset's bundled files with sizes and these cited sources. If a rule the
work needs is not in the delivered content, report a scoped load gap; do not
claim coverage of a rule you did not receive, and do not fill the gap from a
source read as if it were a load.

1. Establish the actual working repository and its Git remotes. Read its
   `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`, configured `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` when present,
   and applicable engineering instructions. The plugin installation directory
   is a source location, never the work's repository or checkout.
2. Natively load the SDLC entry and its required orchestrator dependency before
   route selection. Apply current user authorization and source precedence from
   the host. If a repository distributes a different shared-process revision,
   identify that conflict and its effect before the dependent action; installing
   a plugin does not silently revoke the repository's instructions.
3. The bundled tracker supplies Sidkik's GitHub mechanics. Resolve the owning
   delivery issue from its full URL and actual work scope. Planning documents
   belong to `sidkik/planning`, including single-repository work launched in a
   delivery checkout. Before writing them, natively invoke
   [work-artifacts](../work-artifacts/SKILL.md), whose result delivers the
   planning storage/publication convention. Delivery implementation, maintained technical
   documentation, implementation evidence and implementation-session continuity
   retain their delivery owner; a sufficient small repair brief can remain
   issue-owned. This does not reassign implementation issues to planning.
   Discover the actual configured owner before creating work.
4. Resolve engineering instructions through their configured canonical owner.
   Follow the working repository's explicit ownership/migration configuration
   and applicable user decisions for architecture, testing and local-development
   rules, specialist briefs and maintained governing references. When that owner
   is an engineering plugin, use its canonical sources or exact installed bundle
   for those instructions. From any starting repository, route contributions to
   the plugin-owned sources to the owner's authorized checkout; generated bundles,
   native skills and agents remain distribution outputs.
   For Core's explicitly adopted migration, `sidkik/core-plugins` owns these
   engineering instructions under `core-engineering/source`. Legacy Core copies
   of migrated instructions cannot silently override that authority; report
   conflicts before dependent work. This scoped migration preserves unrelated
   repository instructions and does not require other repositories to depend on
   the private plugin.
   The working delivery repository retains implementation code and tests,
   runtime/configuration and live environment, tool and operational facts.
   Observe its write boundaries and the source owner's separate write boundaries;
   a starting directory does not authorize writes to another checkout. Runtime
   commands come from the installed crew runtime documentation and skills.
   Report missing source access or capabilities for the affected action; a plugin
   does not grant permissions or authenticate a CLI.
5. Preserve Pocock's pinned sources and Sidkik's deliberate invocation-only
   adaptation: the Pocock workflows are model-invocable, so invoke the selected
   flow natively from the user's ordinary request; loading grants no authority
   and decides nothing for the human. For a skill still restricted to the user,
   follow the SDLC entry's handoff: provide the actual installed slash command
   with the current work reference and wait for the user's invocation. Source
   inspection may identify that command; it cannot replace invoking or
   authorize executing the flow. If no valid invocation is exposed, report the
   capability gap and hold only dependent work. Sidkik's process
   and tracker adaptations govern local-tracker defaults. Optional flows named
   by the broader Pocock router but absent here remain unavailable until their
   actual source is installed; never claim to have applied a missing skill.

Historical research and decision pointers are immutable upstream links. They
supply provenance when relevant; installed local sources supply required process
steps. A private GitHub link still requires access. This package provides agent
instructions, not authenticated enforcement or a workflow engine.
